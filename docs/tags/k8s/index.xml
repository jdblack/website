&lt;p&gt;What sort of performance impact does Jiva replication have on drive performance
in K8s?  I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find any recent, quick numbers, so I did some
quick and slopping testing for myself and was shocked by the results&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ceph in K8s</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this note, I cover the details that I have uncovered thus far with rook and
ceph.  Ceph is a distributed filesystem that provides persistent storage,
S3-like object store and NFS support in one happy container.  Ceph can be quite
difficult to install the first couple times. Rook is intended to make deploying
Ceph much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Ceph&amp;rsquo;s resource requirements exceed that of my little home lab,
which consists of four systems with four cores and sixteen gigs of ram each.  I
managed to get a quick glance at prometheus just before the eviction storm and
saw that a whopping 72 pods were spun up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly exploring topic in depth will have to wait until I add more mores,
preferably with more ram and CPU.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
