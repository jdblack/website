My life of nerdom started when a friend's father brougth home a teensy little
[Timex Sinclair 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_1000). The
machine weighted in at 2 kilobytes of ram and had a screen that was 32x24 
characters. I only had a few opportunities to play with it, but I was already
hooked.
