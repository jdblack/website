My nerdlife started when a friend's father brought home a teensy little
computer named the [Timex Sinclair
1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_1000).  characters. My
opportunities with the machine were limited, but I became quicly hooked. Within
a few months, I had my own computer of my own, a [Tandy Color Computer
2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIdJqM63A6k&ab_channel=NewsmakersTech), also
known as a CoCo2. These machines, sold at Radio Shack, were rather limited in
nature, having sported 16K of ram, a 0.896Mhz processor and a 32x16 text
display.  Mine came with a tape drive that was horribly unreliable, but such
were the times.  Within a couple years, I got my hands on a Commodore 64,
started programming trivial little things, and even ran a BBS for a bit named
the Hidden Alcove.

I joined the military shotly after high school, where I learned electronics,
radio & radar and other such skills as would befit someone focused on Naval
Weapon systems. At the time, I couldn't stand the experience, but my fondness
for this time period has grown over time. Thanks to the Navy, I had the chance
to see half a dozen countries before I could legally drink in my own country! I
built a family while in the Navy
